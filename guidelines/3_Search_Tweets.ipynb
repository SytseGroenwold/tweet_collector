    "## Requirements\n",
    "In order to search tweets using tweet_collector, you need to set the **endpoint**, **credentials**, and **configurations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Endpoint\n",
    "In order to find Tweets related to the topic of your interest, you may search tweets using two endpoints, **recent search** ,or **full-archive search**. A recent search will yield Tweets from the **past 7 days**, while the full-archive search goes back to the first public Tweet from **March 2006**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please keep in your mind that **full-archive search is accessible only through the Academic Research product track.** If you do not have access to an Academic Research account, you still can poll or listen to tweets using a [standard product track](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/introduction).  \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, this library expects to find the endpoint in `config/.twitter_keys.yaml`. To create this file, run the following code in **Terminal**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd tweet_collector\n",
    "mkdir config\n",
    "cd config\n",
    "touch .twitter_keys.yaml\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: Please keep in your mind that '.twitter_keys.yaml' is a hidden file. To read such a file you need to check 'show hidden files' in the file manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.A. Recent Search\n",
    "To execute a recent search, the endpoint specification needs to be set to 'recent'. The ‘recent’ search endpoint provides Tweets from the **past 7 days**. To use recent search endpoint, copy the following code in `.twitter_keys.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "search_tweets_v2:\n",
    "  endpoint:  https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.B. Full-archive Search\n",
    "To execute a full-archive search, the endpoint specification needs to be set to 'all'. This endpoint provides access to all publicly available Tweets posted **since March 2006**. To use the full-archive search endpoint, copy the following code in `.twitter_keys.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "search_tweets_v2:\n",
    "  endpoint:  https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/all\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Credentials\n",
    "The credential file holds your Twitter credentials. They can be set either as environment variables or in a yaml file that includes the endpoint.(i.e., `.twitter_keys.yaml`). An example of such a credential file can be found at `guidelines/example/.twitter_keys.yaml`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The simplest credential file should look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "search_tweets_v2:\n",
    "  endpoint:  https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/...\n",
    "  consumer_key: ek...\n",
    "  consumer_secret: hy...\n",
    "  bearer_token: AA...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "OR \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* To set credentials as environment variables, run the following code in **Terminal**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "export consumer_key=[ek...]\n",
    "export consumer_secret=[hy...]\n",
    "export bearer_token=[AA...]\n",

    "The configuration file generally contains three groups of elements: **search rules (including search query)**, **search paramters**, and **output paramters**.

    "#### 3.A. Search rules\n",
    "As the name suggests, the `[search_rules]` should contain all search filters necessary for your research. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Time/id filters\n",
    "To filter Tweets based on time/id, use one or more of the following search rules:\n",
    "```\n",
    "start_time = <Start of datetime window, format ‘YYYY-mm-DDTHH:MM’> \n",
    "end_time = <End of datetime window, format ‘YYYY-mm-DDTHH:MM’>\n",
    "since_id = <Tweet ID, will start search from Tweets after this one>\n",
    "until_id = <Tweet ID, will end search from Tweets before this one>\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example: if you want to look back for relevant Tweets till may 2021, you can use `start_time = 2021-05-01`*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adding extra info\n",
    "To include extra information to your results, you can use various **'..._fields'** rules (see [this page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user) for more info):\n",
    "```\n",
    "tweet_fields = <A comma-delimited list of Tweet JSON attributes to include in endpoint responses>\n",
    "place_fields = <A comma-delimited list of Twitter Place JSON attributes to include in endpoint responses>\n",
    "user_fields = <A comma-delimited list of User JSON attributes to include in endpoint responses>\n",
    "media_fields = <A comma-delimited list of media JSON attributes to include in endpoint responses>\n",
    "poll_fields = <A comma-delimited list of Twitter Place JSON attributes to include in endpoint responses>\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example: if you want to know more about the geographical information of the filtered tweets, such as the country and country code, you can include `geo_fields = country,country_code`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. To be able to include (one of) these extra fields listed above, you also need to provide the **'expansions'** rule:\n",
    "```\n",
    "expansions = <A comma-delimited list of expansions. Specified expansions results in full objects in the ‘includes’ response object>\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example: if you wish to include `geo_fields = country,country_code` you have to include `expansions = geo.place_id`. While the place ID will be located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional place fields in the 'includes' data object. (Please see [this page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user) for ..._fields-expansions pairs.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Search query\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the most import rule, is your search query:\n",
    "```\n",
    "query = <Search query>\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the query specification, you enter how you wish to filter Tweets. Commonly used arugments are:\n",
    "* `<key_word1> OR <key_word2>`: look for Tweets including either word1 or word2 *(Example: happy OR happiness finds Tweets with the words happy or happiness in them)*\n",
    "* `lang:<lang>`: only receive Tweets that are in specific langauge *(Example, lang:en selects only English Tweets)*\n",
    "* `-is:<type>`: '-' is a negation operator; excludes certain types of Tweets *(Example: -is:retweet exclused retweets, leaving only original Tweets)* \n",
    "* `-<key_word>`: '-' is a negation operator; excludes Tweets with key_word in it *(Example: -birthday excludes Tweets with 'birthday' in them)*\n",
    "* `has:<prop>`: matches Tweets that have specific property *(Example: has:geo selectes Tweets with Tweet-specific geolocation data provided by the Twitter user)*\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you want to look for original Tweets in English related to happy or happiness containing at least one hashtag, but are not related to birthday whishes, we write:\n",
    "```\n",
    "query = (happy or happiness) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet has:hashtags\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
