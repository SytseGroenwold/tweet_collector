    "### Adding data in Kibana\n",
    "Now, when you click on `Kibana visualize & analyze` you can add the imported data. To do this, perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on `Add your data`\n",
    "2. Click on `Create index pattern`\n",
    "3. Provide an index pattern name, in this case *twitter*, and click `Next step`\n",
    "4. Select time field,'created_at'.\n",
    "5. Click `Create index pattern`\n",
    "6. The final step is an overview of the imported data and it's mapping/type structure.\\* You don't need to change anything.\n",

    "### Creating a dashboard\n",
    "To create a visualization of the twitter data:\n",
    "1. Select `Dashboard` from the main menu in the upper left corner, in `Analytics` section.\n",
    "2. Click on `Create new dashboard`\n",
    "3. Click on `Create panel`. It shows multiple visualization options.\n",
    "4. You can choose `Lens` which is recomended for many users.\n",

    "- By dragging fields to the center of the screen, you can create graphs. You can personalize the graphs by means of form (e.g., stacked bar, area, bar, etc.) and by defining `Break down by`, splitting up your graph even further. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure to select the right timeframe (see calender icon on the right of the screen) matching your Twitter filter. The default value of this 'time filter' is '15 minutes ago - now'. So, for example, if you've filtered tweets untill a certain end date (that is before 15 minutes ago), this will leave you with an empty list of `Available fields`.\n",
